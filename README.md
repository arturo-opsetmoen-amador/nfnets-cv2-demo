# Code to run a demo of nfnets with cv2

This repository contains code to run the newly released NFNet model. The code is heavily based in Google's 
implementation for the ICLR 2021 paper
["Characterizing signal propagation to close the performance gap in unnormalized
ResNets,"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06171) by Andrew Brock, Soham De, and
Samuel L. Smith, and the arXiv preprint ["High-Performance Large-Scale Image
Recognition Without Normalization"](http://dpmd.ai/06171) by
Andrew Brock, Soham De, Samuel L. Smith, and Karen Simonyan.
